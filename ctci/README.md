# CTCI

A listing of associated key tricks to apply when dealing with solving problems.

## General

1. Start with conditionals first to focus on the core algorithm.

## Arrays

1. Convert down to ASCII integer values for comparison.
1. To conserve space, use bit vectors.
1. Count characters in a string using a hash table.
1. Clarify permutations. Chaging order is one definition.
1. It is easier to replace characters in an array by working backward.
1. Palindromes operate on even and odd number of characters.
