# CTCI

A listing of associated key strategies to apply when solving problems.

## Todo

1. Implement a HashMap
1. Implement an ArrayList
1. Implement a StringBuilder

## General

1. Start with conditionals first to focus on the core algorithm.
1. When concating many strings, use a StringBuilder.
1. Solve problems in numerous languages to understand idomatic differences.

## Arrays

1. Convert down to ASCII integer values for comparison.
1. To conserve space, use bit vectors.
1. Count characters in a string using a hash table.
1. Clarify permutations. Chaging order is one definition.
1. It is easier to replace characters in an array by working backward.
1. Palindromes operate on even and odd number of characters.
1. To optimize space, use the transformation matrix as storage.

## Linked Lists

1. Duplicates can be removed in a singly linked list by using a slow and fast pointer.

## Takeaways

1. ABC's of programming. Thirty minutes of day has lasting effects.
1. Stop, think, and walk through the problem verbally first.
1. Do not overthink the solution. Think Occam's razor. Go with the simplest solution.
1. When a solution is unclear, visualize the steps to implement.
1. There is joy in solving problems.
