# CTCI

A listing of associated key tricks to apply when dealing with solving problems.

## Todo

1. Implement a HashMap
1. Implement an ArrayList
1. Implement a StringBuilder

## General

1. Start with conditionals first to focus on the core algorithm.
1. When concating many strings, use a StringBuilder.

## Arrays

1. Convert down to ASCII integer values for comparison.
1. To conserve space, use bit vectors.
1. Count characters in a string using a hash table.
1. Clarify permutations. Chaging order is one definition.
1. It is easier to replace characters in an array by working backward.
1. Palindromes operate on even and odd number of characters.

## Takeaways

1. ABC's of programming. Thirty minutes of day has lasting effects.
1. Solve problems in numerous languages to understand idomatic differences.
1. Stop, think, and walk through the problem verbally first.
1. Do not overthink the solution. Think Occam's razor. Go with the simplest solution.
